# prime no is number that can only be divided by 1 and itself only
# program to find if the given number is a prime number or not
# num = int(input("Enter the number:"))
# flag = 0

# if num <= 1:
#     print("The number is not a prime number")

# else:
#     for i in range(2,num//2+1):
#         if num%i == 0:
#             flag = 1
#             break
#     if flag == 1:
#         print("The number is not a prime number")
#     else:
#         print("The number is a prime number")
        


# Another approach
# num = int(input("Enter the number:"))

# if num < 2:
#     print("The number is not a prime number")

# else:
#     for i in range(2, int(n**0.5)+1)
#         if num%i == 0:
#             print("The number is not a prime number")
#             break
#     else:
#         print("The number is a prime number")
